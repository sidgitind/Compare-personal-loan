# Loan Interest Calculator

## Overview

This project is a loan interest calculator built using Brython, a Python-to-JavaScript compiler. It allows users to input loan details and calculate the total interest for two different loan options, taking into account various parameters such as part payments and prepayment charges.

## Features

- **Principal and Tenure Input**: Enter the principal amount and loan tenure.
- **Interest Rate**: Specify interest rates for two loan options.
- **Part Payments**: Input part payments as a comma-separated list.
- **Part Payment Charges**: Define charges based on the duration of the loan.
- **Minimum and Maximum Part Payments**: Set limits for part payments.
- **Maximum Annual Prepayments**: Define the maximum number of annual prepayments allowed.

To build this app, I have used Google's Gemini and ChatGPT.
Gemini helped me build the python code. While ChatGPT came handy in packing the code to host it on Github.
